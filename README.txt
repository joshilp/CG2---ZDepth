I managed to successfully implement all requested features for this assignment.

Page 4: Made a scene that contains several scaled boxes with some boxes (or parts of boxes) as far back as Z=-200, and some as close as Z=0. These boxes are rendered with depth cueing, from full green (0, 1, 0) for the near color to full black (0, 0, 0) for the far color. In addition, I have shown rotations, translations, and scales of boxes, which have been rendered using filled polygons.

Page 5: In simp format, using at least one file command, I made a scene that shows off rotations, scale, and transformations using my own chosen colors with 2 different shapes. One shape is a cylinder, and the other shapes are pyramids.

Pages 6 to 8: M programs reads and displays page6.simp, page7.simp, and page8.simp.


DDALineRenderer now has RGB interpolation, and takes a z value so polygons can now be drawn with z depth.

CTM transformations are implemented in the Transformation file.
